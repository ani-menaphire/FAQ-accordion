## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

This is my first challenge where I tried to write semantic markup and was mindful of accessibility. It was also a reminder for me on how to work with JS. 


### Continued development

I really want to be able to write clean and readable code. At the moment I think it's good enough that it's functional but sloppy. I also want to get enough practice making these simple challenges so that they won't take as much time to make as they do now.
